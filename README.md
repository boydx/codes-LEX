## Code Enforcement: A weapon of gentrification?

This map explores patterns of code enforcement citations in Lexington, KY. It examines who makes code complaints, and where these complaints cluster between 2012-2017.

A note on data sources and privacy:
The data for the map was obtained via an open data request from the LFUCG Department of Code Enforcement.</a> The original dataset contained all resolved code violations related to residential properties between 2012 and 2017. While an ideal map would provide full details for all code violations by address, this data has been cleaned and aggregated, and the map zoom limited, to prevent identifiable information from being released publicly. This has been done to respect the wishes of concerned community residents. Thus, please be considerate before using data/map.
